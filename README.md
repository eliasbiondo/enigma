# Enigma Machine Simulator

This project is a simulation of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used during World War II. The application allows users to interact with a virtual Enigma machine, providing a hands-on experience with historical cryptography.

## Features

- **Rotor Configuration**: Select and configure rotors to customize the encryption process.
- **Plugboard Setup**: Visualize and modify plugboard connections.
- **Real-time Encryption**: Type plaintext to see the corresponding ciphered text instantly.
- **Interactive Lamps**: Visual feedback with lamps lighting up for each key press.

## Project Structure

- **app**: Contains the main application files and layout components.
- **components**: Reusable UI components such as buttons, rotors, and the plugboard connection graph.
- **context**: Manages the Enigma machine's state and context.
- **lib**: Core logic for the Enigma machine, including rotors and plugboard configurations.
